***Contributions are welcome!***

## Extra Features
It's all managed using Minecraft commands.
This mod adds two new commands: `/speedrunner` and `/hunters`.

## How it works:
If you're not familiar with Dream's Minecraft Manhunt series on Youtube, you should check that out.
* You can set the speedrunner by using `/speedrunner set <target>`. That sets that specific Player to be the speedrunner.
* You can view who the speedrunner is by using `/speedrunner get`.
* You can unset the speedrunner by using `/speedrunner clear`.

<br/>

* You can add hunters by using `/hunters add <target>`.
* You can clear the hunter list by using `/hunters clear`.
* You can get the hunter list by using `/hunters get`.

### Differences:
* This mod uses the lodestone compass mechanic introduced in Minecraft 1.16.
* This mod is configurable! Yes! You can view the comments in the config itself to understand it.

This mod also adds a Cloth Config screen you can open using Mod Menu (client-side only, of course).

## Planned Features
* Freezing - Freezes hunters when speedrunner looks at them
* Actual win/loss system
